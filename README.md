# Dotfiles
Here are the dotfiles I have for my iMac, fully inspired by the work from others (see below).

## Contents

- [.bash_profiles](https://github.com/teraflopx/dotfiles/blob/master/.bash_profile) loads dotfiles and sets some shell options

### TODO
* Extend .bash_profile so that ~/.path can be used to extend `$PATH`; ~/.extra can be used for other settings not to commit
