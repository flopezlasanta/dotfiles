# Dotfiles
Here are the dotfiles I have for my iMac, fully inspired by the work from others (see Thanks section)

## Contents

[.bash_profiles](https://github.com/teraflopx/dotfiles/blob/master/.bash_profile) loads dotfiles and sets some shell options

In order: 
- [.bash_prompt](https://github.com/teraflopx/dotfiles/blob/master/.bash_prompt) customizes the look and feel of the prompt
- [.bash_dev](https://github.com/teraflopx/dotfiles/blob/master/.bash_dev) configures SSH and development tools (Java, Scala, Mongo...)
- [.bash_alias](https://github.com/teraflopx/dotfiles/blob/master/.bash_alias) adds aliases and functions for general needs
- [.bash_docker](https://github.com/teraflopx/dotfiles/blob/master/.bash_docker) adds aliases and functions for [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

### TODO
* [ ] Extend .bash_profile to have ~/.path for extending `$PATH` and ~/.extra for other settings that should not be committed
* [ ] Add dotfile for [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) formulae
* [ ] Add dotfile for recipes with common Docker containers (e.g. Chrome, Tor, ...)
* [ ] Add dotfile for OS X customization
